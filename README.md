Fake News Article Detection
 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes textual content of news articles and classifies them as Fake or Real based on learned linguistic patterns.

 Objectives

Identify misleading or fake news articles automatically

Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing

Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification

Reduce manual effort in verifying online news content

 Methodology

The project follows these steps:

Data Collection – Uses a labeled fake/real news dataset

Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing

Removing stopwords

Tokenization

Lemmatization

Feature Extraction

TF-IDF Vectorization

Model Training

Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM (mention what you used)

Prediction & Evaluation

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

 Technologies Used

Python

NLTK / spaCy

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)

 Results

The model achieves good classification performance and effectively distinguishes fake news from real news articles based on textual features.
