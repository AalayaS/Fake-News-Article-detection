# Fake News Article Detection 

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The system analyzes textual content of news articles and classifies them as **Fake** or **Real** based on learned linguistic patterns.

---

##  Objectives
- Identify misleading or fake news articles automatically  
- Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification  
- Reduce manual effort in verifying online news content  

---

##  Methodology
The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection** – Uses a labeled fake/real news dataset  
2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing  
   - Removing stopwords  
   - Tokenization  
   - Lemmatization  
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization  
4. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

##  Technologies Used
- Python   
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

##  Results
The model demonstrates effective performance in distinguishing fake news from real news articles using textual features.
